- Remember to `git add` untracked files before doing nix evals.
- If developing a working version of a library or dependency, and needing to test changes from the consuming flake, use the `--override-input` arg in nix evals, e.g. `--override-input nixdoc path:./tmp/nixdoc/`. Do not change the input url/path directly in the consumer.
- Local development dependencies are in `tmp/` (gitignored)
