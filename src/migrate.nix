/*
  Registry migration: detect renames and generate sed commands to update references.

  When directories are renamed, registry paths change. This module:
  1. Scans files for registry.X.Y patterns
  2. Compares against current registry to find broken references
  3. Suggests mappings from old names to new names
  4. Generates sed commands to fix all references

  Usage:
    migrate = import ./migrate.nix { inherit lib; };

    # Get migration commands
    migrate.detectRenames {
      registry = currentRegistry;
      files = [ ./nix/outputs ./nix/flake ];
    }
